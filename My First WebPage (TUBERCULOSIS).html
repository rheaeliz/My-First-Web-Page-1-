<h1>Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread by inhaling tiny droplets from an
infected person's coughs or sneezes. </h1>
<p><h1>The lungs are the most affected, but it can affect any
part of the body, including the stomach (abdomen), glands, bones, and nervous system. TB is a potentially fatal condition,
but it is curable if treated with the appropriate antibiotics.</h1> </p>

<h1> History of World TB Day </h1>

<p>
<h2> Dr. Robert Koch announced the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, on March 24, 1882. (TB). </p>

<p>
	<h2>TB killed one out of every seven people in the United States and Europe during this time period.
	Dr. Koch's discovery was the most significant step toward controlling and eliminating this deadly disease. </h2>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>A century later, March 24 was designated as World Tuberculosis Day: a day to educate the public about the
	global impact of tuberculosis. World TB Day will not be celebrated until tuberculosis is eradicated. </h2>
</p> 
<h2>
However, it is an excellent opportunity to educate the public about the devastation caused by tuberculosis
and how it can be stopped.

	<h1>How did the first case of tuberculosis started?</h1>
</p>
<p>
	<h2>Even if scientists believe that humans first acquired tuberculosis in Africa around 5,000 years ago,
there is evidence that the first tuberculosis infection occurred around 9,000 years ago. Along trade routes,
it spread to other humans. It also infected domesticated animals in Africa, including goats and cows.</h2>

<h1 style="background-color:white;"> CAUSES: </h1>
</center>
<ul>
<li> <h1>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</h1></li>
<li> <h1>It is spread when a person with active tuberculosis in their lungs coughs or sneezes
and someone else inhalesthe TB bacteria-containing expelled droplets. Although tuberculosis is spread in a
similar manner to a cold or flu, it is not as contagious</h1><li>
<h1>To catch the infection, you would have to be in close contact with an infected person
for an extended period of time (several hours). The reason for these is that, not everyone who has tuberculosis is contagious.
Children with tuberculosis (TB) or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs do not spread the infection.</h1></li>

	<h1>TWO MAIN TYPES OF TUBERCULOSIS: Latent TB and Active TB</h1>
	</p>
</center>
</body>
</html>
	
<h1 style="background-color:yellow;"> LATENT TB<h2>
<p><h2>- TB bacteria can live in the body without making you sick.
This is called latent TB infection. In most people who breathe
in TB bacteria <h2></p><p> and become infected, the body is able to fight the
bacteria to stop them from growing. 
People with latent TB infection includes:</p>

<ul>
  <h2><li>Have no symptoms</li>
  <li>Don’t feel sick</li>
  <li>Can’t spread TB bacteria to othersS</li>
  <li>Usually have a positive TB skin test reaction or positive TB blood test</li>
  <li>May develop TB disease if they do not receive treatment for latent TB infection.</li></h2>
</ul>
<p><h1>Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease.
In these people, the TB bacteria remain inactive for a lifetime without causing disease.
But in other people, especially people who have a weak immune system, the bacteria become active, multiply, and cause TB disease.</p></h1>
</body>
</html>

<body>
<html>

<h1 style="background-color:yellow;"> ACTIVE TB<h2>
<p>- Active TB disease is contagious. That means it can be spread from one person to another.
It is most often spread through the air. The germs may enter the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs or sneezes.
People nearby may breathe in these germs and get infected.  People get sick from the TB germs that are alive and active.
This means that they are growing and destroying tissues in a person’s body. TB was once the leading cause of death in the United States.
Today, we have many medicines to treat and cure TB disease.</p>

<h2>Risk Factors</h2>

<ul>
  <h1><li>Being in close contact with a person with active TB disease</li>
  <li>People who were born, traveled, or have lived overseas</li>
  <li>Contact with groups known for passing on TB, such as the homeless, injection drug users, and persons with HIV/AIDS</li>
  <li>Living or working with people who are at high risk for TB, such as those in hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons, nursing homes, or refugee camps.</li></h1>

	<center><img src="picture5.jpg"width="530px" height="340px"></center>
<p>
<center><h1>When TB bacteria are inhaled, they can settle in the lungs and begin to grow.
They can then travel through the blood to other parts of the body, including the kidney, spine, and brain. </h1> </p></center>

<p>
<h2>Tuberculosis in the lungs or throat can be contagious. This means that the bacteria has the potential to spread to other people.
Other parts of the body, such as the kidney or spine, are usually not infected with tuberculosis. People who have tuberculosis are more likely
to spread it to the people they spend the majority of their time with. This includes relatives, friends, and coworkers or classmates.<h2></p>

<center><h1 style="background-color:white;"> How TB Spreads?</h1></center>
<h2>TB bacteria spread from person to person through the air. TB bacteria can enter the air when a person with TB disease
of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. People in the vicinity may inhale these bacteria and become infected.</h2>
	<center><img src="picture7.jpg"width="530px" height="340px"></center>
<p>
<h1>TB is NOT spread by:</h1>
<h2><li>shaking someone’s hand</li>
  <li>sharing food or drink</li>
  <li>touching bed linens or toilet seats</li>
  <li>sharing toothbrushes</li></h2>
<h1>Anyone can get TB, but those at greatest risk include people:</h1>
<ol>
<h2><li>Who live in, come from, or have spent time in a TB-infested country or region</li>
  <li>prolonged close contact with an infected person</li>
  <li>Lives in crowded conditions</li>
  <li>People that is very young or very old.(Because the immune systems of people who are young or
  elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults)</li>
  <li>Lives in crowded conditions</li>
  <li>Who has poor health or a poor diet as a result of lifestyle and
  other problems. Ex. Misuse or abuse of drugs and alcohol misuse, or homelessness.</li></h2>
